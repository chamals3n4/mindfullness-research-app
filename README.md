# MindFlow - Mindfulness Research App

## About This Project

This is a research project conducted by SLIIT and Brain Labs. The application serves as a data collection tool for experimental and control groups participating in a mindfulness study. The app helps researchers gather valuable data on participants' mental wellness through various interactive features.

## Overview

MindFlow is a comprehensive mindfulness research application designed specifically for academic research purposes. The app enables participants to track their mental wellness through daily reflections, stress monitoring, and guided breathing exercises. It provides researchers with structured data collection mechanisms while offering participants an engaging way to monitor their mental health journey.

## Key Features

### 1. Daily Sliders
Participants can track their:
- **Stress Levels**: Rate stress on a scale of 1-10
- **Mood**: Track daily mood from bad to good (1-5 scale)
- **Sleep Quality**: Assess sleep quality from poor to excellent (1-5 scale)
- **Influencing Factors**: Select factors affecting their stress levels from a predefined list
- **Sleep Schedule**: Record sleep start and wake-up times

After submitting their ratings, participants can engage in guided breathing exercises (4-minute sessions) with visual breathing cues. Post-exercise, they rate their relaxation level to complete the mindfulness session.

#### 1.1 Voice Guidance (Experimental Group Only)
Participants with research IDs ending in ".ex" have access to weekly voice guidance:
- Listen to mindfulness guidance recordings uploaded by research coordinators
- Access to weekly themed audio sessions for enhanced mindfulness practice
- Playback controls with visual progress indicators
- Automatic URL construction for weekly guidance files stored in Cloudflare R2

### 2. Weekly Questions (Weekly Whispers)
Participants receive thought-provoking questions each week to encourage deeper reflection on their mindfulness journey. The feature includes:
- 10 weekly questions that change periodically
- Text-based responses for each question
- Progress tracking and completion celebrations

#### 2.1 Vocal Biomarker Capture
As part of the weekly questionnaire process, participants are required to complete a vocal biomarker capture:
- Read a standardized passage aloud for vocal analysis
- Audio recording with duration validation (15-45 seconds)
- WAV format recording with quality settings
- Upload to Cloudflare R2 storage for research analysis
- Database metadata storage linking recordings to questionnaire responses

### 3. Main Questionnaire
A comprehensive assessment tool featuring standardized psychological scales:
- **Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)**: 10-item questionnaire measuring stress perception
- **Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)**: 15-item assessment of mindfulness facets
- Time tracking for completion analytics
- Structured submission process

### 4. Progress Tracking
Visual dashboard showing participant engagement metrics:
- Daily slider completion rates
- Weekly question participation
- Main questionnaire progress
- Streak tracking for consistent engagement
- 6-month progress visualization

### 5. Personal Profile Management
- User authentication and account management
- Profile customization options
- Research identification tracking
- Password management capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with tab-based navigation
- **UI Components**: Custom SVG icons, animated elements with Reanimated
- **State Management**: React Context API for session management
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data caching
- **Audio**: Expo AV for recording and playback

### Backend
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for media storage
- **API**: Supabase RESTful API

### Database Schema

The application uses Supabase PostgreSQL with the following key tables:

1. `profiles` - User profile information
2. `about_me_profiles` - Detailed user background information
3. `daily_sliders` - Daily wellness assessments
4. `weekly_answers` - Weekly reflection responses
5. `main_question_sets` - Standardized questionnaire versions
6. `main_questions` - Individual questions within questionnaires
7. `main_questionnaire_responses` - User responses to main questionnaires
8. `voice_recordings` - Metadata for audio recordings

### Key Tables Structure

#### 4. `weekly_answers`
- Purpose: Store participant responses to weekly reflection questions
- Structure: Fixed set of 10 weekly questions with user responses
- Fields: user_id, week_id (format: YYYY-WNN-WQ), a1-a10 (text responses), submitted_at
- Refresh: Questions reset every Monday at 00:00 AM

#### 8. `voice_recordings`
- Purpose: Store metadata for participant voice recordings
- Structure: Voice recording metadata for both vocal biomarker capture and weekly guidance
- Fields: id, user_id, week_number, year, file_key, file_url, created_at, updated_at
- RLS Policies: Row-level security ensures users can only access their own recordings

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
